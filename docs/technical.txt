Bugs! Technical Notes -*- mode: outline -*-

* Board
- Board is defined as 2D grid (potentially sparsely defined if we desire
  odd shaped boards)
- How to handle "elevation"?
  + Will there be elevated positions where pieces can overlap due to
    being at different elevations?
- Different terrain types are encoded as integer values; more interesting
  "features" are represented not as terrain but as "pieces" on the board
- The board state may change during the course of the game (ant building a bridge)

* Pieces
- Players bugs are represented as pieces
- Obstacle creatures are represented as pieces
- "Objects" and board features are also thusly represented (toadstool, 
  leaves on the ground, flowers)

* Various notes
- Every N seconds, the board clock ticks up (distributed event)
- Pieces record the clock at their most recent move and do not allow
  further movement until the clock changes (they render themselves
  specially after having been moved and return to normal rendering on the
  next clock tick)
- On the server, a tick() is effected once per second or so wherein
 "autonomous" pieces decide whether they wish to make their move
- As the player moves pieces (or autonomous pieces move), some pieces will
  automatically react in the appropriate way (if a slow piece travels in
  front of a frog it will eat the piece, etc.)

* TODO
- Cancel a path if the piece we're pathing for moves (or strip off the
  first move if the piece moves along the new path)
- Add a little scrolly window to the editor that allows the player to move
  the VirtualMediaPanel around the board
- Fix problem where pieceId is not set properly when loading a board
- Figure out how to scroll the board in the actual game as well
- Refactor goal to do isMet() and isBotched() at same time
