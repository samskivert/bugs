Bugs Taxonomy -*- mode: outline -*-

* Player controlled
- Ant: ground-based, slow speed, can carry blades of grass and build bridges
- Bee: air-based, medium speed, can pollinate flowers, scare flies
- Beetle: ground-based, slow speed, only predator is frogs, can defend
  against other predators and "ram" spiders causing them to drop their prey
- Caterpillar: can eat tall grass and turn it into blades for ants to
  carry (after eating three tiles of grass, one leaf is shat out); can eat
  venus fly trap (turns into two leaves)
- Termite: can eat through fallen branches

- Lady bug: air-based, medium speed, eats aphids


* Computer controller
- Frog: eats anything; stays in one place and rotates
- Lizard: eats anything; stays attached to a tree and rotates around it
- Wasp: air-based, medium speed, territorial around flowers, will try
  sting bees or other insects who come near which results in drastic loss
  of energy
- Scorpion: ground-based, slow speed, wanders the ground eating small
  insects and stinging larger ones to cause them to lose energy (maybe
  replace with antlion larva)
- Spider: ground-based, medium speed, wanders the ground grabbing small
  insects, taking them to a web and coccooning them, maybe spins new webs?
- Fly: gravitates toward and eats food, scared of bees
- Venus fly trap: eats air-borne insects, remains closed while digesting,
  a good place toward which to scare flies

- Aphids: air-based, slow speed, gravitate toward flowers, eat them
