Bugs! Game Design Notes -*- mode: outline -*-

* Piece types
- A "refueling" bug that can help bugs that have run out of energy
  (perhaps bees that drink pollen can return to the hive and convert it to
  honey)

* Board loading
- Define a board format
- Read in the board
- Provide a mechanism in the lobby to load a custom board

* Implement the end game
- Certain insect types must "return home"
  + ants to their ant hill
  + bees to their hive
- By placing an insect's home on the board, it establishes a goal to get
  some percentage of those insects back home

* Flowers and pollination
- Implement flowers
- Add an attribute to bees (pollenated by flowerId) and flowers
- Adding flowers creates a goal to pollenate all flowers with pollen from
  some other flower
- Should flowers come in pairs? Such that flowers must exchange pollen
  rather than be pollenated by any arbitrary flower?
- When a bee deposits pollen, can they simultaneously receive the pollen
  from that flower?
- Should flowers all have unique colors so that the bee can be colored
  according to the flower whose pollen it carries?

* Food
- Implement an energy level for each insect that drops over time
- Add a few kinds of food pieces that an insect can eat, which raises
  their energy level
- Add flies which slowly gravitate toward food and eat it
  + flies can be eaten by player's predatory bugs
  + can they also be led into the path of demise by fooling them into
    flying near a venus fly trap or other predator? if so, how?
- Pollinating a flower provides bees with energy (they drink the nectar)
- Eating another bug provides the diner with energy
