Bugs was a prototype for a turn-based strategy game about bugs (hence the clever working title).

I eventually decided that trying to come up with mechanics that fit the theme was too much
additional burden beyond just creating a workable basic TBS design, so I abandoned the prototype
and moved on to a prototype using "standard" tanks, infantry, etc. called
[Bang](https://github.com/greyhavens/bang-game) (there we go again with the clever titles).

That eventually evolved into [Bang! Howdy](http://banghowdy.com/) which shipped and (sort of) still
runs today.

This all unfortunately predates my use of the Maven Ant tasks, so if you want to build it you have
to track down ye olde versions of all the libraries in `lib/BANG_LIBS`. Maybe I'll modernize the
build at some point just for kicks. In my copious spare time.
